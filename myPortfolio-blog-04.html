            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>As a learner, today i initiated a new course on stock market. Stock market is the epicenter of
                    trading stock
                    globally.It comprises of shares of companies and ventures. <br><br>

                    CA Rachna Ranade started the seminar by mentioning the awareness of stock market among Indians with
                    whom she
                    had come through. A market is a place where where buying and selling of goods takes place.
                    Similarly, in
                    stock market is a place where shares of a company is involved in buyimg and selling. There are
                    several
                    myths(false belief) which still persists.<br><br>

                    <strong>1. Investing in stock is Risky :</strong> <br><br>
                    A graph of sensex points to corresponding yeari.e.from 2001 to present was presented by her. The
                    graph shows
                    that the sensex during 2001 - 2003 was low bit not null.Ups and downs are the part of the life, and
                    for the
                    stock market it is essential. In a long run investing in shares can be fruitful can be understood
                    through
                    the graph. The graph gradually increases from beginning to present year.In yr 2008 -09, a bank was
                    decpared
                    bankrupted overnight and corruption by govt officials resulted in heavy plunge in the sensex. Also
                    the after
                    the 2014 Lok sabha polls the bjp govt or modi sarkar headed the throne of india and sensex pts
                    increases
                    afterwards.Is there any reltion between the Lok sabha polls and the sensex pts? asked speaker. She
                    answers
                    confidently,"No". Cause in not the BJP or NDA but the stability of government provided by the
                    leaders.
                    Theerefore the myth is proven wrong as Lastng Term Capital Income in 99% of case is gain.<br><br>

                    <strong> 2. Professionals in finance can only invest in stock market:</strong><br><br>

                    The answer is no.Not only the professionals but the person with bit of financial underatanding and
                    knowledge
                    can proceed for the investment in the stock markets.Warren Buffet, one among the billionare in the
                    world
                    mentioned in one of his book-At the age of 11 he started investing in stock markets and later he
                    stated that
                    he has started investing too late.<br>
